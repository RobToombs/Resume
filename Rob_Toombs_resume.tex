  \item Led the modernization of an outdated Java 8 EC2 API into a Go Fargate API, while decreasing the code base by \textasciitilde{}60\%, increasing test coverage to over 90\%, and increasing transaction per second throughput from \textasciitilde{}300 TPS to 1000+ TPS
  \item Led the development of a content service API designed to increase content availability resilience for frontend services, decrease response times, and eliminate complicated business knowledge requirements for UI content retrieval
  \item Mentored Boston school students in learning basic website development fundamentals as part of Capital One Coders
\end{itemize}
